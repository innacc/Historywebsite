            <p><b>Photography was first developed in the 1700s by French Scientists. Very early photographs were blurry, dull, and unintelligible. Advancements in photography in the early 1800s improved immage quality, but because it took hours to take a single photo, photography was mostly still images of the rich with very little facial expression. As time went on, scientific advancments improved photography. In the mid 1800s, photography could now be used to photograph more than just lifeless portraits. These advancements lead to the social documentaries of the mid 1800s.</b></p>
